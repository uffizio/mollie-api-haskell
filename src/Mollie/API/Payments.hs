  Helper to create a minimal new payment for recurring use.

  A payment created with this helper should be sent with the
  `createCustomerPayment` from `Mollie.API.Customers` or have
  the customerId set.

  For a first recurring payment use `newPayment` and set the
  recurring type to `First`, because it needs a return url.
